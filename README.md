# Train-Scheduler

This application uses Firebase to store input data for train schedules.  Users are able to add the train name, destination, first train time and the departure frequency of their schedule.  With this information the application will display the next arrival time and how many minutes away the next train is relative to the current time.  In addition, users from different machines are able to view the same train times.
